<h2><a href="http://axiom3d.net" target="_blank">Axiom 3D Rendering Engine</a></h2>
<p><img class="logo" alt="Axiom Icon" src="http://cloud.ohloh.net/attachments/66254/AxiomIcon_med.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" />The Axiom 3D Rendering Engine is a fully object oriented 3D graphics engine using C# and the .Net platform. Axiom 3D aims to be an easy to use, flexible, extendable, and powerful engine that allows for rapid development of games and other graphical applications. By using the .Net framework as the target platform, developers can focus more on core functionality and logic, rather than dealing with the complexities of languages like C++.</p>
<p>The core of Axiom is a port of the very popular OGRE graphics engine, which was chosen based on its clean object-oriented design, powerful features, and flexibilty. The original port was carried out by <a title="User:Leedgitar" href="http://axiom3d.net/wiki/index.php/User:Leedgitar">Leedgitar</a>, the project founder. I (borrillis) have been maintaining the project since 2005. During that time the project has added iOS, Android, Silverlight and Windows Phone as deployment targets.</p>

Passionate RPG gamers gathered to create an open and freely available game. You will have no surprises of premium content which will limit your gameplay or unbalance the game. There are no limitations in skills, ranks, abilities, items you can gain with your free account. There are no time limits or additional constraints. Donations are gladly accepted. Servers and bandwidth are provided by sponsors.</p>
<p>PlaneShift is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.planeshift.it/Source%20code" style="color: #ffaa11; text-decoration: none;">Open Source</a>&nbsp;for the client and server code, and we accepts contributions from the community. We need your help to make this game better.</p>
<p>I worked with the PlaneShift team from 2004-2007. I implemented a few different features, including some spells, the Advisor system and the Pets system. I also worked on some of the tooling to help the artists create the UI without having to load the full game.</p>
