<p>In my last post, I discussed how to use the XNA GS 4.0 Content Pipeline project along side the MonoGame Game projects. Since the release of MonoGame 3.0, the MonoGame team has been hard at work in implementing their own Content Pipeline to build xnb files.</p>  <p>My only criticism at this point is that it currently does not maintain compatibility with existing XNA GS 4.0 Projects. I donâ€™t think this will be a showstopper for many peple, but it would be nice not to have to slice up existing projects to make it all work.</p>  <p>Be sure to check out the video on their blog: <a title="http://www.monogame.net/news/2013/01/31/cross-platform-content-pipeline-preview" href="http://www.monogame.net/news/2013/01/31/cross-platform-content-pipeline-preview">http://www.monogame.net/news/2013/01/31/cross-platform-content-pipeline-preview</a></p>
