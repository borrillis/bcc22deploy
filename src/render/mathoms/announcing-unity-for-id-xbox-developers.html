<p>Chris Charla, Director of <a href="mailto:ID@Xbox">ID@Xbox</a>, <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/11/xbox-one-unity-id" target="_blank">posted</a> today on the Xbox blog some really great news for game developers who want to, or have thought about creating games for the Xbox One. The Xbox team has been posting information slowly about the <a href="mailto:ID@Xbox">ID@Xbox</a> program which is the way for Indies to self publish on the Xbox One platform. The news today lets us know that the toolset of choice is Unity, which we were already told about <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/xbox-one-unity-announcement" target="_blank">previously</a>, but it lacked details. </p> <p>So the details:</p> <ol> <li><a href="mailto:ID@Xbox">ID@Xbox</a> members will receive the <strong>Xbox One add-on for Unity</strong> at no additional cost.  <li><a href="mailto:ID@Xbox">ID@Xbox</a> member will receive special <strong>Xbox One-only Unity Pro</strong> seat licenses</li></ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is freaking awesome! With the other announcements surrounding Unity 4.2 including free exporters for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, game developers can target all the Microsoft platforms with a single toolset for FREE*.</p> <p>* You will need a license for Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro ( for Windows Phone development ) and Developer Subscription for the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store, which may or may not cost you real money. </p>
