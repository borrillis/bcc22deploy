In October 2013, Hacking Pediatrics held the first hackathon ever focused on pediatric healthcare. It was sponsored by Boston Children's Hospital in collaboration with MIT's H@cking Medicine. In under 36 hours, 16 teams brought to life incredible ideas that will change the lives of children and their families and we are doing it again this year. Hacking Pediatrics Hackathon 2.0 will once again bring together the most innovative minds to disrupt pediatric healthcare.

*The 2014 hackathon will be held October 17th -19th at the Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge, MA.*
