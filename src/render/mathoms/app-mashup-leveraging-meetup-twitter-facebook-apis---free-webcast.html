<p>In this one-hour online workshop you will learn how to <strong>develop Windows 8 apps using the Twitter, Meetup and Facebook APIs.</strong> Twitter, Meetup and Facebook are the premier social networking sites and their API&rsquo;s provide access to Tweets, Meetups and Friends. What a great combination! We will cover how to access the Twitter, Meetup and Facebook web service API&rsquo;s from code, deserialize the response into a set of runtime objects that you can bind to Windows 8 UX Controls such as the GridView and the ListView. You will also receive instructions on how to <strong>submit your app to the Windows 8 store.</strong>&nbsp; This workshop is great for students, hobbyists and professional developers who want to learn the basics of app development and publish their first app to the store.</p>
