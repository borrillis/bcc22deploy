<p>Ok, so I am really bored tonight and avoiding working on some presentations I need to finish, but this was just a little bit of fun. The great minds at Microsoft thought that it would be interesting to make the PDC brain 'intelligent' and offer up a web site where you can ask it questions. It reminded me a bit of those old Eliza-esque programs that basically repeated back what you said in question for, but only less knowledgeable. Below is a snippet of our 'conversation'.</p>

<p>So go ahead and have you own bit of fun with the brain at <a href="http://askthebrain.net/">http://askthebrain.net/</a></p>
