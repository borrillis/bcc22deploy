The Microsoft and Nokia Evangelists are teaming up to help you publish your Windows Phone Apps!  <h2>Schedule</h2> <ul> <li><strong>12 PM DevCenter Submission Walkthrough</strong> (30 minutes): See just how easy it is to submit and publish an app worldwide  <li><strong>12:30 PM Build an app in 30 minutes with App Studio</strong> (30 minutes): See how to build an app from an idea to publishable in 30 minutes, literally.  <li><strong>1 PM - 1:30 PM Lunch</strong>: food and snacks are provided. This is when you think about what you need help with or when you should think of your app idea for App Studio.  <li><strong>1:30-6 PM Hands-on time</strong>: The experts will be available to help during this time. They will be walking around helping and/or attending to requests for help.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; <p>By the end of the day fully expect your app(s) will be ready and submitted to DevCenter and on it’s way to the global app marketplace.  <h2>What will you need to bring?</h2> <ul> <li>If you need help on an existing app, bring your laptop, complete with a dev environment and&nbsp; your app on it.  <li>If you want to build an app without any code, bring a laptop that has a modern browser (IE10-11, Chrome). You’ll only need your browser to build and submit the app to the store. If you do not have a Windows Phone, the experts will be able to help you test the app on their phone.</li></ul> <h2>Giveaways</h2> <p>Everyone who attends and publishes their app will be entered to <strong>win a “hero” Nokia Lumia (1020, 928, 925, 920, etc) of their choice</strong>. There’ll be some swag/prize surprises during the day of the event.  <p>Note: If you accept a prize from Nokia, you agree to <a href="http://nokiawpdev.wordpress.com/resources/prizes-and-winnings-disclaimer/">these</a> terms.
