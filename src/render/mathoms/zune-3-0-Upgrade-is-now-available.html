<p>So, I saw a post this morning that let me know the Zune 3.0 release had occurred. I dutifully started my Zune software and tried to sign in. After accepting the new license agreement, the Zune software recognized that an update was available and politely asked if I wanted to upgrade. </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Downloading...</p>
<p>And then this:</p>

<p>Ok, so I'm running Windows Server 2008 as my desktop, so what? Am I to be punished because I need to run server products on a daily basis and using a VM to do so is a pain? Now I have to install Vista in a VM in order to use the latest Zune software? Oh, and it would have to be VMWare because lame ass VPC doesn't do USB devices yet.</p>
<p>The previous version of the Zune software runs excellently under 2008, I hope this gets resolved soon.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.danrigsby.com/blog/index.php/2008/09/16/zune-30-and-windows-server-2008-64-bit/#comment-1113">Was able to install it following these steps</a>    
1. Uninstall Zune 2.5    
2. Extract the files from zunesetuppkg-x86 using zunesetuppkg-x86.exe /extract    
3. Run the Zune-x86.msi from the packages folder</p>
