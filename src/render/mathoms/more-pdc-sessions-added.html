Now I had already gone and added a bunch of interesting sessions to my schedule, most of my time slots are now triple or even quadruple booked. I got quite a shock as I was looking at the neat tag cloud thingy they have for browsing the sessions by topic. </p>

<p>Can you believe it? There is a session for XNA! I was quite impressed that there were two sessions at TechEd Developers for XNA. </p>
<p>My top topics so far are : Oslo, Identity, Cloud Services, Languages, Live Mesh and Sync Framework</p>
<p>I'm sure more will creep in as time goes on, I know that I'll do a couple SharePoint and Silverlight sessions. </p>
<p>See you there!</p>
