I ended up doing 3 out of my 4 proposed presentations, the fourth had some technical difficulties I'll get to in a separate post. As promised ( and a requirement of a Code Camp ) I'm making the presentation slides and source available for download.</p>  <p>I have some additional notes for a couple of my presentations:</p>  <h2>XNA Terrain</h2>  <p>I mentioned in my talk some Terrain Editors out in the wild, I cam across <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=42507&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">this one</a> tonight, very cool.</p>  <h2>SharePoint Branding </h2>  <p>I had mentioned a CodePlex project for Branding MySites, I can't seem to find the project any more, but I do have a link to the details <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2007/03/22/customizing-moss-2007-my-sites-within-the-enterprise.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p>I had a lot of fun doing the presentations and I hope everyone else did too. Use the link below to download the presentations.</p> <iframe style="border-right: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-right: 0px; border-top: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 3px; border-left: #dde5e9 1px solid; width: 240px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #dde5e9 1px solid; height: 66px; background-color: #ffffff" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-75af48400819b619.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/Code%20Camp%2010%20-%20Dev%20InTENsity" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
