<p>I just noticed this upcoming course on the Microsoft Virtual Academy given by a couple of my fellow Technical Evangelists. It&rsquo;s a free one day course on lots of the gaming engines available for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. Be sure to register and attend this course if you are interested in game programming for Windows 8.</p>
<p>The full details of the class are on the <a title="Gaming Engines for Windows 8 Jump Start" href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/liveevents/gaming-engines-for-windows-8-jump-start?CR_CC=200263145#fbid=9mA6M7cbtud" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> site.</p>

<p>This Jump Start takes you through every aspect of developing games for Windows 8, from figuring out your audience to getting them to pay for your product. It includes demos and lots of tips on using gaming tools such as Construct2 by Scirra, GameMaker by YoYo Games, and Unity. Learn it all from three Microsoft Technical Evangelists with a passion for the technology: <a href="http://twitter.com/codefoster">Jeremy Foster</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/palermo4">Michael Palermo</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamTuliper">Adam Tuliper</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Planning your game: define your audience, market and technologies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Game assets: images, models, and audio<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Construct2 by Scirra: a game engine creating elegant UI<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - GameMaker by YoYo Games: game-making power at your fingertips<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Unity: 3D games on multiple platforms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Monetization and Store submission: the payoff</p>

<p>Jeremy was educated in computer engineering and mathematics then gathered disparate industry experience in education, aerospace manufacturing, and insurance. With just enough - and not nearly enough - education and experience, he finally joined Microsoft with the goal of informing and inspiring software developers to write code and to &ldquo;write it right.&rdquo; When he is not working, he is likely spending time with his wife and son, hiking and camping, sailing, scuba diving, or working on house projects.</p>
