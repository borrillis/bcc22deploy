<p><a href="http://www.togetheratpdc.info"><img height="80" border="0" align="left" width="132" src="/Media/Default/Media/Default/Migrated/Together@PDC2008_3.gif" alt="Together@PDC2008" style="border: 0px none ;"></a> So I am at the PDC this year with the Together @ PDC2008 program from Microsoft. This allows various people to go to the PDC with Microsoft Employees. This year I am buddied up with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbowen">Chris Bowen</a>, my Regional Developer Evangelist.</p>
<p>There are some special events that you get to do on Sunday before the event starts, mostly just some networking stuff and a few presentations. As part of the deal to hang out with the Microsofties, I had to agree to bring the PDC back to my area. If you haven't <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/archive/2008/10/24/msdn-developer-conference-bringing-pdc-home.aspx">already heard about this</a>, Microsoft is holding little mini PDC's in many cities around the country called <a href="http://www.msdndevcon.com">MSDN Developers Conference</a>. As a participant in the Together@ program I'll be presenting one of the topics (TBD) at the Boston event on January 22nd 2009.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/MSDN-Developer-Conference-MDC/81861700542">Facebook page</a> for the event , "Building on the buzz, excitement, and industry-changing announcements of the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC), the MSDN Developer Conference will deliver the core message, content, and experience of the PDC in a one-day, multi-track event to multiple cities across the United States."</p>
<p>The agenda is already online at the site and there are a lot of very cool topics. The event will only cost $99 when registration opens up on Monday October 20th 2008. Hope to see you there!</p>
