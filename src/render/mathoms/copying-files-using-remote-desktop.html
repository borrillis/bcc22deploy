<p>I have a mental block on this so I'm making sure I don't forget it by putting it up here. If you want to copy/paste files from your desktop to the server your remoted into, you have to make sure you allow your local drives to be accessed by the remoting session. Once you do that copy/paste works as expected.</p>  <p><a href="http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/mathoms/WindowsLiveWriter/CopyingFilesusingRemoteDesktop_A1C3/image_2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="354" alt="image" src="/Media/Default/Media/Default/Migrated/image_thumb.png" width="477" border="0"></a></p>
