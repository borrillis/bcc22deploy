The big announcement that year was 'ActiveX'. It was a great event and I have high hopes for this years event as well.     This year the topic seems to be 'cloud computing'. I'm going to enjoy steeping myself into this technology. I just <a href="javascript:void(0);/*1219227350156*/">found out</a> that Don Box is now going to be part of the keynote as well. It's sure to be a great time and there'll be more reports here.
